Module_11 Challenge
This project consists of two parts. In part one I use Beautfifulsoup to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. In part two I use Beautifulsoup and Pandas to scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table on a website. In order to do the second part I used Beautifulsoup to scrape the table from the website and Pandas to load it into a Dataframe. Then I used various Pandas and Matplotlib functions such as to analyze and visualize the data to answer 5 questions.
